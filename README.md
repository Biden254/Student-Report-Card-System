## Project Overview

This project is a Java console application that collects full student performance data and generates a formatted scoresheet similar to the sample provided in the assignment instructions.

The program demonstrates key programming concepts including:

User input with Scanner

Arrays for storing student records

Loops for processing data

Control statements for ranking logic

Formatted output using printf

Computing totals, averages, and grade distribution

The final output replicates the exact alignment and structure of the sample scoresheet.

# Assignment Requirements
✔ 1. School Details Input

The program prompts the user to enter:

School Name

Teacher Name

Grade

Year

These appear at the top of the generated report.

✔ 2. Student Records (Arrays Used)

The program requires 12 students, and uses arrays to store:

Student names

Marks for English, Math, History, Geography, Science, Programming

Total marks

Final rank

All student inputs are collected using Scanner.

✔ 3. Computing Student Results

For each student, the program calculates:

Total Marks = Sum of all six subjects

# Ranking System:

Total Marks	Rank
≥ 540	A
≥ 480 & < 540	B
≥ 420 & < 480	C
≥ 360 & < 420	D
< 360	F
✔ 4. Class Statistics

At the bottom of the scoresheet, the program computes and displays:

Total marks for each subject

Average marks for each subject

Count of A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, and F’s

✔ 5. Output Format

The output is formatted with printf to match the sample exactly, including:

Header section

Table column alignment

Separator lines

Rank column right-aligned

Totals and averages section

### How to Run the Program

Make sure you have Java installed (JDK 8+).

# Compile the program:

javac StudentScoresheet.java
